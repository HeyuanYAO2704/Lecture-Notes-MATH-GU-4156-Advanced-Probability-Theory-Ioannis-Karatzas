 # This is the lecture notes of MATH GU 4156 Advanced Probability Theory, instructed by Prof. Ioannis Karatzas in Fall 2023.

 # Prof. Ioannis Karatzas is the Eugene Higgins Professor of Applied Probability in in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Statistics, Columbia University in the City of New York.

 # The main topics contains 
 The notion and properties of Conditional Expectation. Martingales, Filtrations and Stopping Times. Optional Sampling and Systems theorems. Convergence, square-integrability, Inequalities, Laws of Large Numbers. Martingales in Markov Chains. Convergence of algorithms, the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation. Optimal stopping: super-harmonic functions, free-boundary problems.
 Definition and properties of Brownian Motion. Study of paths: reflection principle, modulus of continuity, law of the iterated logarithm, Skorokhod embedding and its implications. Associated martingales. Definition and properties of the stochastic integral, Itoâ€™s calculus, change of measure, the Girsanov theorem. Stochastic Integral Equations. Diffusions: connections with partial differential equations, the Poisson and Dirichlet problems.
 Applications: Optimal Filtering and Control. Relative Entropy and its dissipation, Fisher information, Inequalities. Basic notions of Optimal Transport, Wasserstein distances, conservative diffusions as flows of steepest descent for the relative entropy. Notions of finance: portfolios, arbitrage, hedging, optimization.

 # I design the series of notes primarily for PhD students at the Georgia Institute of Technology, for those who are not familiar with martingale-related theories.
 
 # And of course, I got the approval from Prof. Ioannis Karatzas to share these notes to students in need.
 
 # If you have any suggestions to improve those notes, please contact me (hy2704@columbia.edu) and I welcome criticism and advice!
